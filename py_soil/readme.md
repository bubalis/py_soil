## Introduction
\
This module provides python functions for soil-property estimation and other soil-related processing, including runoff and erosion.

These functions are embedded within high-complexity watershed models like SWAT or APEX, but sometimes researchers may need these functions as stand-alone building blocks.



## Soil Structure

This sub-module contains functions for estimating several soil-structural paramters.
Most importantly, it gives several methods for calculating the USLE soil-erodibility factor (K). 



## Soil Water

This sub-module gives several methods for different soil water parameters. 
These functions can be combined to estimate a range of important parameters based on soil texture, bulk density and soil organic matter


## Runoff
Contains implementations of the NRCS curve-number method, including methods to estimate peak runoff rates.
Additionally, it contains several different implementations of the green and ampt method for runoff estimation.


## CN_GA_conversions
Contains a number of functions for putting the results of a curve-number estimate in terms of Green-Ampt and vice-versa.


##Erosion

Contains a few functions for estimating erosion, including the USLE and the MUSLE.


## Installation
\
To install, download this repository and run  

```pip freeze -r requirements.txt ```

Many functions here were adapted from the technical documentation and source code of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT).
